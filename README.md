# 🥋 Code Kata

**Code Kata** is an educational repository for systematic practice in programming and machine learning. The name is inspired by kata in martial arts — formalized repetitive training designed to sharpen technique.

The project includes implementations of algorithms and models both **from scratch** and using **libraries** (`NumPy`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `PyTorch`, and others). This approach helps to deeply understand the principles behind algorithms and learn how to apply them in practice.

## 📦 Dependencies

* [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) (optional)
* [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) (optional)

## 🚧 Why “Kata”?

> In martial arts, a kata is a formalized practice routine to automate movements.
> In programming, it’s a path to deep understanding through repetition and variation.

This repository is built around the idea of regular practice: by repeating and analyzing the implementation of the same algorithm in different ways, you build intuition, confidence, and flexibility.
