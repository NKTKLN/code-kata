# 📊 Machine Learning

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks implementing classical machine learning algorithms. It covers both foundational methods and some advanced techniques to provide a deep understanding of the principles behind these algorithms and how to apply them in practice.

## ⚠️ Skipped / Planned Topics

The following important ML topics are currently **not covered** but planned for future additions:

* Stacking and other advanced ensemble techniques
* Probabilistic Models (Bayesian approaches, latent variable models)
* Deep Learning:
  * Neural networks basics
  * CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, Graph Neural Networks
  * Training techniques and theory
* Generative Models (VAE, GANs, Normalizing Flows, Diffusion Models)
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Recommender Systems
* Unsupervised Learning:
  * Clustering
  * Dimensionality reduction
* Time Series Analysis and ARIMA models
* Reinforcement Learning
* Theoretical ML foundations (Bias-Variance, PAC-Bayes, etc.)
* Optimization methods (SGD convergence, proximal methods, second-order methods)
* Online learning and stochastic optimization
